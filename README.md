# Hivemind

A collaborative, version-controlled mindmap. First version was built during the [FOSS 2020 Hackathon](https://fossunited.org/hackathon) organized by FOSS United.

Hivemind is intended to let users collaboratively create and edit shared mind maps. All changes are automatically revision-controlled, and users can time-travel to any point in the past to look at historic versions of their work.

Hivemind will also let users tag specific versions of their work for easy future reference, and allow them to share their maps with other users (with admin/read-write/read-only access) or publicly (via link, read-only).

## Vision

Hivemind was envisioned to have the following features:

1. Version control - rewind your mindmap to any previous state.
2. Sharing - share your mindmap with read/write/admin access to authenticated users, or make it publicly visible (read-only) to everyone.
3. Collaborative, realtime editing - all users with write access to a mindmap should be able to simultaneously edit it, and view each other's changes in real time.
4. Provide advanced editing features, viewport control and graph navigation using keyboard shortcuts, and a command console whose capabilities far exceed the feature set offered by the point-and-click GUI. The goal is to let power users get hyper-productive - ideally achieving the efficiency and speed of an expert spreadsheet user - where they create mindmaps at the speed of thought ðŸ˜Ž.

Hivemind is under active development, and some of its project goals may be altered over time, though the essense of the vision should remain largely intact.
